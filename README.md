# Ames-sale-preds-R-project
The challenge my project was based on was to use a data set of homes and their sale prices to find what attributes of a house influenced its sale price, and in what way. Then, to build a prediction model on the data. For my project, I used R. I ended up testing four different statistical models, with the most successful being a gradient-boosted decision tree model using the XGBoost library. After making my final predictions on the test dataset and submitting them to Kaggle, I ended up with an error score of 0.2., which means my model had an accuracy of about 80%. There is definitely room for improvement in my project, but it was an excellent learning experience, and my first attempt at machine learning that provided fairly accurate results! I even got to present my work to data scientists from Securian Financial.

This statistics project was based on the Kaggle challenge found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
